# Vex-AI-Vision-Cube-Robot
My independent project for my high school robotics project. My goal was to take 4 Ai vision sensors and a custom drivebase to expand my understanding of how Ai classification works.
# the robot uses:
(Hardware list not finished)
# Motors
2 5.5 Watt V5 Motors
4 8 Watt V5 Motors (Blue Insert)
1 8 Watt V5 Motors (Red Insert)

# Sensors
3 V5 Absolute Rotational Sensors
4 V5 Ai Vision Sensors (Front, Left, Right, Back)
1 Laser Distance Sensor

# Hardware
~600g of white PETG (OVERTURE PETG is what i used)
